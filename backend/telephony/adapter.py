"""
Telephony Adapter Module — Abstract Interface & Carrier Provider Contracts.

This module decouples external PSTN telephony vendor details (Plivo, Asterisk, Twilio)
from the core business workflow and call state machine using the Adapter pattern.

Design Invariants:
    - All implementations must be non-blocking and safe for asynchronous frameworks.
    - Vendor-specific credentials and SDK calls are isolated behind this interface.

Dependencies:
    - pydantic >= 2.0
